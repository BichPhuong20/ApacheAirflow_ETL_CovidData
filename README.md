# ETL Covid-19 Data Pipeline using Apache Airflow
This project focuses on designing, implementing, and managing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes for integrating Covid-19 data from various sources into a PostgreSQL database. Additionally, the project utilizes Apache Airflow to automate ETL workflows.

## Project Overview

### 1. ETL Processes and Data Pipeline:
- Python scripts are developed to extract data from multiple Covid-19 data sources.
- Transformation steps are applied to clean and preprocess the data for consistency.
- The cleaned data is loaded into a PostgreSQL database for easy querying and analysis.

### 2. Apache Airflow Application:
- Apache Airflow is implemented to automate the ETL workflows.
- Tasks are orchestrated, scheduled, and monitored through Apache Airflow's web interface.
